# home_service_bot_resub2
Resubmission for Udacity's Home Service Bot Project

Final Project for Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree that simulates a robot operating on ROS to find an object and deliver it to a goal

## Shell Scripts
The shell scripts are accessed by the following command
`./<catkin_dir>/src/scripts/<shell name>.sh`

### test_slam.sh
o	This script utilizes the gmapping package which uses a robotâ€™s laser sensor and pose data to map its environment while being navigated by the user. 
o	Gmapping uses Rao-Blackwellized particle filters in which each particle contains its own map of the environment which learns a grid map.
